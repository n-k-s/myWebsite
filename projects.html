                Developed a RuneScape automation bot using the DreamBot API
                in Java. Automation consisted of a bot that scans the perimeter
                for x and y coordinates within a 2d grid for nearby monsters
                and defeats them. Automation was handled by the DreamBot
                interface where scripts are uploaded and executed.

                This is a remake on the classic pong game, made with P5.js. It's fully functional with controls
                and a score keeper.

                This was a group project that I did using JavaFX to recreate the Game of Life. The rules are:
                Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
                Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
                Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
                Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
